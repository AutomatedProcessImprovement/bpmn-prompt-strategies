I have the BPMN model of a business process.

The tasks in a BPMN model represent specific activities within the business process. Each task signifies a step that must be performed to complete the process. The tasks included in this BPMN model are:

Mfcag0hpk9D (task)
nzRTSE5N6M0VmhO (task)
eCf5D2kqxO26isW (task)
BUnFi016oV1lxjw (task)
S9ZSbxQ4IClZY5k (task)
GYsytF1k0348i0G (task)
ELwuJQ1n2M7TXBS (task)
HyTfsLyY72gom92 (task)
DKBpKux7x7ow8C5 (task)
xoV60NvHePrxEL6 (task)
cdNqQmM7wopCZAb (task)
TlA2xP931pyQH6V (task)
VrM4L9wUEsyAq5B (task)
q5mYY5dcwDfKEd (task)
B2EVBqCXlHYkUEV (task)
yPoEMlWFG58llAG (task)
t1IMLAOx023C3Lt (task)
PRxaoYT1VpHsK5z (task)
Isk0is1iWZp4OKR (task)
T5bE4R33wkOo9 (task)
VnI1jPoi2ZXscxX (task)

Events in a BPMN model represent occurrences that affect the flow of the process. They can signify the start, intermediate, or end of a process. In this BPMN model, the events are:

StartEvent_1rq8aoe (START)
Event_0qidd2m (END)
Event_171qhxw (END)

Gateways in a BPMN model control the process flow by either diverging into multiple paths or converging different paths back together. There are two types of gateways:

- **Parallel Gateway (AND):** This type can only be fired when all its incoming flows are 'active', and its firing activates all its outgoing flows.

- **Exclusive Gateway (OR):** This type allows only one of its outgoing flows to be taken based on predefined conditions. The choice of which flow to take is determined at runtime.

Gateway_0zpizct (Gateway_0zpizct)
Gateway_0pckvrj (Gateway_0pckvrj)
Gateway_1ci6l2o (Gateway_1ci6l2o)

Flows in a BPMN model define the sequence of execution for tasks, events, and gateways. The flows in this model are:

Gateway_0zpizct -> eCf5D2kqxO26isW
Gateway_0zpizct -> BUnFi016oV1lxjw
Gateway_0pckvrj -> GYsytF1k0348i0G
