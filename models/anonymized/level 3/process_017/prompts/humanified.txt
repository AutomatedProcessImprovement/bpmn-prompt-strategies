Explanations for edge types:

"From [A] to [B]" denotes a sequential flow indicating that B is executed after A happened.
"From [A] to [B] and [C]" denotes a flow indicating that both B and C are executed after A happened.
"From [A] to [B] or [C]" denotes a flow indicating that either B or C (but only one) can be executed after A happened.
