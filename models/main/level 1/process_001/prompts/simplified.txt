The tasks in a BPMN model represent specific activities within the business process. Each task signifies a step that must be performed to complete the process. The tasks included in this BPMN model are:

Check loan application (task)
Appraise property (task)
Check credit history (task)
Analyze viability (task)
Prepare notification (task)
AML Check (task)
Send notification (task)

Events in a BPMN model represent occurrences that affect the flow of the process. They can signify the start, intermediate, or end of a process. In this BPMN model, the events are:

StartEvent_1 (Start)
Event_0w0qv5v (End)

Gateways in a BPMN model control the process flow by either diverging into multiple paths or converging different paths back together. There are two types of gateways:

- Parallel Gateway (AND): This type can only be fired when all its incoming flows are 'active', and its firing activates all its outgoing flows.

- Exclusive Gateway (OR): This type allows only one of its outgoing flows to be taken based on predefined conditions. The choice of which flow to take is determined at runtime.

Gateway_0nmpe12 (AND-split)
Gateway_146y8zs (AND-join)

Flows in a BPMN model define the sequence of execution for tasks, events, and gateways. The flows in this model are:

Start -> Check loan application
Check loan application -> AND-split
AND-split -> Check credit history
AND-split -> Appraise property
Check credit history -> Analyze viability
Analyze viability -> AND-join
AND-join -> Prepare notification
Prepare notification -> Send notification
AML Check -> AND-join
Send notification -> End
Appraise property -> AML Check
